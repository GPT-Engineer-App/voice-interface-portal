# voice-interface-portal

Build a Voice User Interface website to be used by a computer science student. The website should be a very modern one and easy to use. It should contain a section which will contain the help command to be used in the VUI. It should contain an output frame for anything that is not text output, a container where images/documents/pdf will be displayed. The user should be able to enable the microphone via a button.
